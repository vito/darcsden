highlighting-kate is a Haskell source code highlighting library, based
on Kate's syntax description files (http://kate-editor.org/).

Currently, the following languages are supported:

Ada, Asp, Awk, Bash, Bibtex, C, Cmake, Coldfusion, Commonlisp, Cpp, Css,
D, Djangotemplate, Doxygen, Dtd, Eiffel, Erlang, Fortran, Haskell,
Html, Java, Javadoc, Javascript, Json, Latex, Lex, LiterateHaskell, Lua,
Makefile, Matlab, Mediawiki, Modula3, Nasm, Objectivec, Ocaml, Pascal,
Perl, Php, Postscript, Prolog, Python, RelaxNG compact, Rhtml, Ruby,
Scala, Scheme, Sgml, Sql, SqlMysql, SqlPostgresql, Tcl, Texinfo, Xml,
Xslt, Yacc

To install:

    runghc Setup.lhs configure
    runghc Setup.lhs build 
    runghc Setup.lhs haddock    # optional, if you want library documentation
    runghc Setup.lhs install    # as root, or specify --user 

For an example of the use of the library, see Highlight.hs.
To compile this program along with the library, specify the 'executable'
flag in the configure step above:

    runghc Setup.lhs configure -fexecutable

To run Highlight, specify the language name using -s:

    Highlight -s haskell Highlight.hs > example.html

If you don't specify a language name, Highlight will try to guess it
from the file extension.  Highlight can also be used as a pipe, reading
input from STDIN.  For other options,

    Highlight --help

Styling is done using span tags.  The Highlight program will include
default styles in the generated HTML, unless a link to a CSS file is
provided using the '--css' option. Some sample CSS files can be found
in the css directory. These use generic class names (Normal, Keyword,
DataType, DecVal, BaseN, Float, Char, String, Comment, Function, Others,
Alert, Error). For more fine-grained highlighting, users may wish to
create their own CSS files that use language-specific classes.

The parsers in Text/Highlighting/Kate/Syntax were automatically generated
from the Kate syntax definitions in the xml directory. You may modify
the xml files in this directory, or add new ones, and then regenerate
the parsers by doing:

    runghc ParseSyntaxFiles.hs xml

Note that ParseSyntaxFiles.hs requires the HXT package.

You can browse the available Kate syntax highlighting files at

    http://kate-editor.org/downloads/syntax_highlighting

or retrieve them all using Subversion:

    svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdelibs/kate/syntax/data kate-data 

There is information on the syntax highlighting definitions at

Thanks are due to all the authors of these syntax definitions.

Changes have been made to the following xml files (the originals have
been left in the directory, with .bkp extensions):

- javascript.xml:  Fixed regex \s* (which matches empty string) by changes to DetectSpaces
- perl.xml:  Fixed regexes - needed backslash-escapes before ] and ^
- haskell.xml:  Added support for module names
- bash.xml: Changed "\\" to "\" in two Detect2Char rules in FindString
- literate-haskell.xml:  Fixed single line comments and growing context stack

NOTE:  This software is largely untested.  Known bugs are recorded in the file
BUGS. Please send bug reports (or better, patches) to the author (jgm at
berkeley dot edu).
