You will need:
- CouchDB, with the databases and views described below.
- Redis

Both should be running on their default port, or just edit
DarcsDen/State/Util.hs to point to different ones.


To install:

    cabal install
    mkdir -p /srv/darcs
    adduser --system --home /srv/darcs --no-create-home --shell /bin/bash --group --gecos "DarcsDen" darcsden
    ssh-keygen -- save to /srv/darcs/.ssh/id_rsa
    chown -R darcsden:darcsden /srv/darcs

    -- make sure CouchDB is running
    darcsden --install


To start:
This package provides separate executables for the web and SSH servers,
`darcsden' and `darcsden-ssh', respectively. I recommend running them in
screen as user "darcsden".

The web server should be started from the directory containing /public, or
you can run it behind nginx or something that'll handle /public requests by
pointing to that directory.
