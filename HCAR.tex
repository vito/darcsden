\url{http://darcsden.com} is a free Darcs \cref{darcs} repository
hosting service, similar to \texttt{patch-tag.com} or (in essence)
\texttt{github}. The darcsden software is also available (on darcsden)
so that anyone can set up a similar service. darcsden is available
under BSD license and was created by Alex Suraci.

Alex keeps the service running and fixes bugs, but is mostly focussed
on other projects. darcsden has a clean UI and codebase and is a
viable hosting option for smaller projects despite occasional
glitches.

The last Hackage release was in 2010. Other committers have been
submitting patches, and the darcsden software is close to becoming a
just-works installable darcs web ui for general use.
